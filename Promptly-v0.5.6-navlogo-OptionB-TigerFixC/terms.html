<p><b>Last updated:</b> 2025-11-01</p>
<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Promptly’s websites, demo interfaces, and any materials we make
available (the “Services”). By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>
<h2>1. Use of the Services</h2>
<p>The Services are provided “as is” for evaluation and educational purposes only. Do not rely on the demo for life‑critical or
production decisions. You are responsible for your inputs and outputs and for ensuring you have the necessary rights to the content
you submit. You may not use the Services to violate law, infringe intellectual property, invade privacy, or harm others.</p>
<h2>2. Accounts & Feedback</h2>
<p>If account features are offered, you must keep credentials confidential. We may use feedback, suggestions, and improvement ideas you
provide to improve the Services without obligation to compensate you.</p>
<h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>We own all rights in the Services, including software, visual design, and trademarks. You retain ownership of your inputs. Subject to
these Terms, we grant you a limited, revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to access and use the demo for lawful, non‑commercial
evaluation.</p>
<h2>4. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>If the demo integrates third‑party APIs or models, your use of those integrations is subject to the third parties’ terms and privacy policies.
We do not control and are not responsible for third‑party services.</p>
<h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. OUTPUTS MAY BE INACCURATE OR UNSUITABLE; YOU MUST INDEPENDENTLY
REVIEW THEM.</p>
<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED USD $100 OR THE AMOUNT
YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICE IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>
<h2>7. Indemnity</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your misuse of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>
<h2>8. Suspension & Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate the Services or your access at any time, with or without notice, including if you violate these Terms or we discontinue
the demo.</p>
<h2>9. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by applicable law in your place of residence, without regard to conflicts of law rules. Where legally permitted,
disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, and you waive the right to participate in a class action.</p>
<h2>10. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and provide additional notice
where appropriate. Continued use after changes means you accept the new Terms.</p>
